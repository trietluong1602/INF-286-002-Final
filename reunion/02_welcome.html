      <h1>Our Class Reunion</h1>

      Who could have imagined in 1956, when you first heard the record you
      should be hearing now, how perfect it would be as a theme for our class
      reunions decades later? For five decades, our class has been fortunate,
      indeed, to have had a handful of devoted classmates who worked together as
      a committee to let the good time roll again and again by giving us a
      succession of fantastic class reunions since our graduation in 1960. In
      2005, we had our fifth one followed by our 50-Year Grand Reunion Gala in
      2010. The makeup of that committee has changed somewhat from reunion to
      reunion, but the result was always spectacular (at least), with the
      enjoyment of all in attendance increasing with each successive one.
      Psychologists say that spending time with old friends is an effective
      stress reliever that can add years to your life. Maybe the success of our
      class reunions are testimony to that notion. To get a sense of the
      enthusiasm about our reunions felt by classmates who have attended, read
      below what one of us wrote in a letter to the reunion committee upon
      learning in 1989 of plans in progress for our 30-year reunion in 1990 (our
      third):
    </font>
    <div class="quote">
      <p class="quote-content">
        "At the risk of being redundant, repetitive or even ridiculous, I must
        respond to your recent report by reciting that nearly nothing could have
        given me more reason to rejoice, I reckon, than to read that you
        reawakened, reactivated, recharged and really resurrected our reposing
        reunion committee, thereby reassuring the rest of us another
        reversionary, reacquainting, refreshing, rejuvenating, rollicking romp
        regressing and recalling, revisiting, reviving, restoring and
        replenishing the rapidly receding remaining remnants of our
        recollections of a kinder, gentler time, to recklessly release and
        relinquish reality, and all reservations and restraints, for one night,
        to rally rigorously in retrospect, renew relationships, and to relish
        ravenously in rapturous revelry — rocking, rolling and reminiscing.
        "After enduring the third successive decadent decade following our
        departure from adolescence, it will indeed be a delight, once again, to
        drastically diminish the distance between us, and momentarily drop, make
        dormant, dispose of, discard, distract ourselves and deviate from the
        deliberate diligence of our daily lives’ disciplined directions, to
        dally and detach ourselves from our individual destinies, drift back
        from the day-to-day difficulties, distresses and deep desperations of
        middle age domain to daydream together deliciously, dwell upon and
        discuss the days of our daring, defiant and debonair youth — and dance,
        dance, dance."

        The following chart is intended to give credit and thanks to those
        committee members who gave us our seven wonderful reunions to date. Our
        unique class Association's Board of Directors formed the nucleus our
        Reunion Committees since 2005. Unfortunately, the available records of
        our early reunions are incomplete, so if anyone has been left out,
        please let me know by e-mail.

        We have also been fortunate to have witnessed an incredible amount of
        history, technological development and social change since our
        graduation from OHS. Much of that is capsulized for your enjoyment on
        the pages that follow. So to reminisce or learn more about our reunions,
        and the historical events, technological developments and social trends
        of each of the four decades leading up to our first four reunions, click
